    //create a function that Changes the towns information! if an instance method on a struct changes any of the structs properties it must be marked as mutating
    //increase the towns instances popilation
    mutating func changePopulation(amount: Int){
        population += amount
    }
}

//tthese properties are mitable because towns pop and num of stoplights are likley to change over time create an instance of Town in the main.swift file 

//Let Town Describe itself
